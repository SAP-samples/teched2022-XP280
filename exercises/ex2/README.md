# Exercise 2 - Set up SAP Cloud Transport Management

In this exercise we will set up SAP Cloud Transport Management service so that it can be used to perform imports of transport requests created by the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service. This setup consists of the following steps:
- Create additional subaccounts which act as targets for the imports
- Subscribe to SAP Cloud Transport Management
- Create a role collection and assign it to your user
- Create an instance of Cloud Transport Management service and a service key
- Create destinations for deployment
- Create transport nodes and routes

## Exercise 2.0 - Create Target Subaccounts for Transport

### Create the Test Subaccount

1. Go to the BTP cockpit of your SAP BTP trial account (global account) to the **Account Explorer**  tab.
2. You should see (at least) one subaccount called **Trial**, which was created when your trial account was set up.
3. You will now create two additional subaccounts that will be used as targets for transporting with SAP Cloud Transport Management.
4. Choose **Create -> Subaccount**.
5. Enter a **Display Name** of your choice, for example *Test*.
6. Enter a **Subdomain** name. Please note that this name must be unique in your region. The input screen provides you with a proposal when you start typing in the **Display Name** field. Accept this proposal.
7. As **Region** choose the region of your trial account.
8. Choose **Create**.
9. The creation of the subaccount takes a few seconds.
10. Click on the new tile.
11. On the **Overview** tab click on **Enable Cloud Foundry**.
12. Leave the **Plan** set to **trial**.
13. You can leave the **Instance Name** as it is.
14. The **Org Name** becomes part of the URL to be used in the destination to deploy content to this subaccount. So you might want to make it a little shorter as the proposal which is created from a combination of global account name and the subdomain name. It must be unique, though. Since the subdomain name has to be unique, too, you could use it as **Org Name** as well (remove the *global account name* part).
15. Choose **Create**.
16. After a few seconds the Cloud Foundry Environment is set up.
17. Click on **Create Space**.
18. Choose a **Space Name**, for example *Test*.
19. Make sure that your user gets the roles **Space Manager** and **Space Developer** assigned. This is the default.
20. Choose **Create**.
21. Go back to the **Account Explorer** view of your trial account by clicking on its name in the breadcrumbs on the top of the screen (next to the globe icon). ![Navigate to global account](images/ex2_subaccounts_010.png)

### Create the Production Subaccount

The steps for creating the second additional subaccount are the same as in the above section, but the subaccount needs a different name. For your convenience they've been written again in this section with the new name needed. 

22. Choose **Create -> Subaccount**.
23. Enter a **Display Name** of your choice, for example *Prod*.
26. Enter a **Subdomain** name. Please note that this name must be unique in your region. So you might want to include some characters specific to your trial account. The input screen provides you with a proposal when you start typing in the **Display Name** field.
27. As **Region**  choose the region of your trial account.
28. Choose **Create**.
29. The creation of the subaccount takes a few seconds.
30. Click on the new tile.
31. On the **Overview** tab click on **Enable Cloud Foundry**.
32. Leave the **Plan** set to **trial**.
33. You can leave the **Instance Name** as it is.
34. The **Org Name** becomes part of the URL to be used in the destination to deploy content to this subaccount. So you might want to make it a little shorter as the proposal which is created from a combination of global account name and the subdomain name. It must be unique, though. Since the subdomain name has to be unique, too, you could use it as **Org Name** as well (remove the *global account name* part).
35. Choose **Create**.
36. After a few seconds the Cloud Foundry Environment is set up.
37. Click on **Create Space**.
38. Choose a **Space Name**, for example *Prod*.
39. Make sure that your user gets the roles **Space Manager** and **Space Developer** assigned. This is the default.
40. Choose **Create**.

You now have (at least) three subaccounts in your trial account.

### Optional: Redistribute Cloud Foundry Entitlements Among Your Subaccounts

Our demo application needs a Cloud Foundry memory entitlement to run. This is necessary for all subaccounts to which it will be deployed. In the trial environment the initial subaccount receives all four available entitlements by default. To deploy the application also to the test and production environment, which is an optional part in exercise 4, you have to redistribute the Cloud Foundry memory entitlement among the three subaccounts.

1. Go to the BTP cockpit of your global trial account holding the three subaccounts.
2. Navigate to **Service Assignments** (to be found under **Entitlements**).
3. Select **Cloud Foundry Runtime** from the drop-down 'Service'. You will see that all 4 units are assigned to one subaccount. ![Default entitlement distribution](images/ex2_entitlements_010.png)
4. Navigate to **Entity Assignments** and click on the selector icon under **Select Entities**.
5. Select the subaccount holding the four Cloud Foundry entitlements (by default called *trial*) and choose **Select**.
6. Choose **Edit**.
7. Scroll down to **Cloud Foundry Runtime** and use the minus (**-**) sign to reduce the number of Units to two (**2**) .
8. Scroll up again and choose **Save**.
9. After saving is completed use the **Select Entities** field again to deselect the **trial** subaccount and select the **Test** subaccount.
10. Choose **Select**.
11. Choose **Edit**.
12. Choose **Add Service Plans**.
13. Scroll down to **Cloud Foundry Runtime**, click on this entry, select the **MEMORY** checkbox and click on **Add 1 Service Plan**.
14. Check that there is **1 Unit** of **Cloud Foundry Runtime MEMORY** assigned to the subaccount and choose **Save**.
15. After saving is completed repeat these steps for your **Prod** subaccount.
16. Navigate to **Service Assignments** (to be found under **Entitlements**).
17. Select **Cloud Foundry Runtime** from the **Service** dropdown menu. Now the Cloud Foundry Runtime entitlements are distributed among your three subaccounts. ![Adapted entitlement distribution](images/ex2_entitlements_110.png)

## Exercise 2.1 - Enable SAP Cloud Transport Management for Use

### Subscribe to SAP Cloud Transport Management

The subaccount which has been created automatically when creating the BTP trial account (called *trial* by default) has all necessary entitlements for enabling SAP Cloud Transport Management. We will use this subaccount for the exercise.

If you want to use another subaccount to enable Cloud Transport Management you have to first make sure that the necessary entitlements are available. Please see the documentation: [Configuring Entitlements to Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/TRANSPORT_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/13894bed9e2d4b25aa34d03d002707f9.html) in that case.

1. Open the BTP cockpit of your trial account.
2. In the **Account Explorer** view click on the tile called **trial**.
3. Open the **Service Marketplace**. It can be found in the **Services** area in the navigation pane.
4. In the Search field enter `Transport`.
5. Click on the **Cloud Transport Management** tile.
6. Choose **Create**.
7. In the **Plan** dropdown menu select **lite** of type **Subscription**.
8. Choose **Create**.
9. Choose **View Subscription**.
10. After a few seconds the status of the subscription should change to **Subscribed**.

### Check your Access to the Cloud Transport Manangement UI

1. Open **Instances and Subscriptions**. It can be found in the **Services** area in the navigation pane.
2. Click on the link to **Cloud Transport Management**.
3. The cTMS overview page should open.

### Create a Cloud Transport Management Service Instance and a Service Key

1. Open **Instances and Subscriptions**. It can be found in the **Services** area in the navigation pane.
2. Choose **Create**.
3. For **Service** choose **Cloud Transport Management**.
4. For **Plan** select **standard** of type **Instance**.
5. Leave the **Runtime Environment** unchanged as **Cloud Foundry**.
6. Leave the **Space** unchanged as **dev**.
7. Select an **Instance Name**, for example *TMS1*.
8. Choose **Create**.
9. After a few seconds the new instance is created.
10. In the row with the new Cloud Management Service instance click on the three dots (**Actions**) and choose **Create Service Key**.

The new service key will be used to enable the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service to upload content to SAP Cloud Transport Management service and to create a transport request.


## Exercise 2.2 - Set Up the Transport Landscape

### Create Destinations

You will now create destinations that will be used to deploy the content built by the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service to the target subaccounts / spaces.

1. Enter the subaccount in which you subscribed to Cloud Transport Management. By default, this should be the one called *Trial*.
2. Open the **Destinations** view (to be found in the **Connectivity** area in the navigation pane).
3. Choose **New Destination** and enter the following:

    <table>
    <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Enter a <b>Name</b> for the destination, for example <i>DEV_MTA</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Type</td>
        <td>Keep <b>HTTP</b>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td><b>Optional:</b> Enter a description.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Url</td>
        <td>The <b>URL</b> follows this pattern: <code>https://deploy-service.cfapps.<mark>&lt;default-domain&gt</mark>/slprot/<mark>&lt;myorg&gt</mark>/<mark>&lt;myspace&gt</mark>/slp</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>default-domain</code> depends on the region your trial subaccount runs in. You can determine it by opening the <b>Overview</b> tab of your subaccount in a second browser tab window. In the <b>Cloud Foundry Environment</b> section you will find the <b>API Endpoint</b>  entry. The part that follows <code>https://api.cf.</code> would be the default domain, for example <code>us10.hana.ondemand.com</code>.</li>
            <li>In the same section you also find the information for <code>myorg</code> and <code>myspace</code>.</li>
            <li><code>myorg</code> can be found under <b>Org Name</b></li>
            <li><code>myspace</code> can be found to the right in the <b>Spaces</b> table in the <b>Name</b> column.</li>
        </ul>   
            The overall URL should look like this (please use your own values!): <br><code>https://deploy-service.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/slprot/123abc45trial/dev/slp</code>.  
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Proxy Type</td>
        <td>Keep <b>Internet</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Authentication</td>
        <td>Change to <b>BasicAuthentication</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>User</td>
        <td>Enter your trial user name as <b>User</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Password</td>
        <td>Enter your <b>Password</b></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

4. Choose **Save**.
5. Click **Check Connection**. The return code should be **200: OK**. Otherwise re-check your entries.
6. **Now repeat** these steps for the other two subaccounts you have created previously and name the destinations for example **TEST_MTA** and **PROD_MTA**.
You should now have a total of three destinations pointing to your three subaccounts.

### Create a Transport Landscape in Cloud Transport Management
